## Remote Control Project
### Week one Homework for Skill Distillery

#### Overview

An simple java application that simulates a remote controller inside the computers terminal. 

#### Concepts

Once users compiles and run the application they will be prompted with.

```
$ To begin, turn on the remote control:
```

The user will have only one option at this point of the application to proceed by typing in "ON". If they type anything else they will be stuck in a loop until they type "ON". Once the action is complete the terminal will print out.

```
$ TURNING ON... 
```

At this point the user will be stuck in a loop. The user will recieve two response from the terminal. If they type any number from 0-9 the terminal will print.

```
$ BOOP!
```

Any other reponse will print.

```
$ Command not recognized
```

But if the user types "OFF" they will break out of the loop ending the application with the final response from the terminal.

```
$ TURNING OFF...
```
